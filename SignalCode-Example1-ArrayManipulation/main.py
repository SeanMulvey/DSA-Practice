# Given an array a, your task is to output an array b of the same length by applying the following transformation: 
# – For each i from 0 to a.length - 1 inclusive, b[i] = a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1]
# – If an element in the sum a[i - 1] + a[i] + a[i + 1] does not exist, use 0 in its place
# – For instance, b[0] = 0 + a[0] + a[1]
